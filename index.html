    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 04, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>File Manager Pro ("we," "our," or "us")</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect and Use</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share your personal data on our servers. All data processing happens locally on your device.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Files and Media (Storage Permissions)</h3>
    <p>Our app requires access to your device's storage to function as a file manager. We request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> To allow you to browse, organize, move, copy, delete, and manage all files on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> To read and save files to your storage.</li>
        <li><strong>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO, READ_MEDIA_AUDIO:</strong> To display and play your media files within the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> This access is used strictly to provide the core functionality of the app (file management). We do not upload your files to any external server.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Biometric Data</h3>
    <p>We may request <strong>Biometric</strong> permissions (Fingerprint or Face unlock).</p>
    <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> This is used solely for the local "App Lock" or "Hidden Folder" features to secure your private files. We do not collect or store your biometric data; the authentication is handled by the Android system.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Device Hardware</h3>
    <p>We use the <strong>VIBRATE</strong> permission to provide haptic feedback during interactions (like long-pressing a file).</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does not use third-party analytics or advertising services that collect personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>3. Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your personal information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
